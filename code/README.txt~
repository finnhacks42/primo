Rough order of steps to callibrate the board.

First test indicator leds are working.

Then test rgb leds are working

Then test light dependent resistors are working

Then upload colorsense and run python script to learn colors - paste results into primoOpticalBoard

Upload code to primoOpticalBoard - and you should correctly be identifying the tiles and sending out code.

TODO: update color_distance.py to use utils and to work from the board or a file.
