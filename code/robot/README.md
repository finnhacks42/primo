## Robot

1. Start with `kinderbot_simple`. This script just uses wheel speed & timing to approximate 90 degree turns. 
2. Check that the bluetooth chips are pairing (you should see them switch from continuous fast flashing to a slower, double flash) and instructions are being received correctly.
3. Tweak the wheel speeds & timing to get reasonable driving
4. If you are feeling adventurous, `kinderbot` was an attempt to use an inertial sensor to get nice straight driving & neat corners. It almost worked but I never managed to get rid of some random noise when reading from the sensor - which threw everything off.
