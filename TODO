Design and 3d print circuit board supports
Cut and test laser cut version of board supports







Export test circuit from KICAD and mill that (ie bluetooth test circuit)
Finish circuit for board and mill it.
Ensure circuit and wood line designs line up
Re-cut wood for board (and a good number of tiles)
Cut acrylic pieces for board
Bring acrylic paints to the space
Design bottom of board to screw on (inkscape)
Breadboard analog multiplexer chip - could simplify things and allow, say a micro, instead of a mega as the arduino. 


Possible extensions and crazy ideas

Aternate programming interfaces - create a physical scratch/blocky implementation. Build on clear table with camera at base - detect numbers/colors on base of blocks to determine type. Could be rasberry pi+camera or similar.
